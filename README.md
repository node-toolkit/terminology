## Terms

### boilerplate

Typically, the term `boilerplate` refers to generic code that is often used when creating projects. Here, we use the term to decribe "boilerplate configurations", which consist of all of the necessary files required to initialize a complete project. Boilerplates can be used by [generators](#generator) to create new projects.

**Related words**: [init](#init), [scaffold](#scaffold), [snippet](#snippet), [template](#template)

### config

Typically used to describe a declarative configuration, consisting of `files` definitions (`src` glob patterns, `dest` directory, and so on), but also sometimes used to describe an `options` object.

### config file

A named file, like `gulpfile.js`, `verbfile.js`, or `generator.js`, that contains custom configuration settings and runtime code for the associated application.

### init

To initialize or create a new project.

**Related projects**: [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate)

### scaffold

Consists of one or more templates or source files and serves as a "temporary support structure" that may be used to initialize a new project, or to provide ad-hoc "components" throughout the duration of a project.

**Related words**: [boilerplate](#boilerplate), [snippet](#snippet), [template](#template)

### snippet

**Related words**: [boilerplate](#boilerplate), [scaffold](#scaffold), [template](#template)

### task

An asynchronous function that wraps code to be executed at a later, pre-determined point.

### template

Resuable file, code or content that contains "placeholder" values, which will eventually be replaced with real values by a rendering (template) engine

**Related words**: [boilerplate](#boilerplate), [scaffold](#scaffold), [snippet](#snippet)
