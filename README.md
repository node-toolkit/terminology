# Terminology

## boilerplate

Boilerplates can be used by [generators](#generator) to create new projects.

**Related words**: [init](#init), [scaffold](#scaffold), [snippet](#snippet), [template](#template)

## config

## config file

A named file, like `gulpfile.js`, `verbfile.js`, or `generator.js`, that contains custom configuration settings and runtime code for the associated application.

## init

To initialize or create a new project.
